# Tokens and codes and secrets

There are a few different kinds of unguessable ("secret") blobs of data,
all of which might easily be termed "tokens" or "codes" or "secrets".

* The login password: This is entered by the user (me) to log in.
    I am the only user for this site, so I don't have a 'users' table containing this value;
    instead I have a singular 'login_password' value in the AppSettings table,
    and I present only a password entry box on the login page.
* The authorization code: Generated by `indieauth.grant()`,
    this value is created from random data when the user logs in and authorizes a given app.
    It is stored in the `AuthorizationCode` table.
    Defined by the IndieAuth spec.
    Sellout Engine prefixes these values with `C-`.
* The bearer token: The application exchanges its authorization code for one of these.
    The exchange happens in `indieauth.bearer()`.
    Also created from random data.
    Stored in the `BearerToken` table.
    (I'm not really issuiing bearer tokens yet, but I will eventually.)
    Defined by the IndieAuth spec.
    Sellout Engine prefixes these values with `B-`.
